            Recapitulation of the lectures
        </h3>
        <p>
            During the first three weeks I mostly had to fresh up my knowledge of JavaScript, seeing as I already knew it, but hadn’t
            used it in over half a year. The first lecture as such consisted of paying attention to the syntax used to remember
            the correct way of programming in JavaScript, such as the var declarations, the way conditionals are written
            (which was pretty much the same as I remembered it) and set me up for further self-study. After week 1 had passed
            I had already started reading up on the topics for week 2 and 3. As such I went well prepared into week 2 and
            3, where I typed along during the lecture and tried to add extra features to see how the page would respond.
            Due to this I deepened my understanding of the complex data types and DOM manipulation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first assignment we had to make was an interface that a user could gather “real-time” information from. For this we had
            to access the DOM and manipulate it to do specific actions. For mine I decided to make a bound, pseudo-random
            number generator that makes a speedometer fluctuate up and down, but tries to balance it around the 10000 mark.
            I used this number to increment a distance travelled number. Secondly I created a form that the user could fill
            in. Once filled in, the next field will present the message typed by the user. Thirdly I implemented a simple
            UTC clock. Lastly I created an image that, once mouse over will present some text to the user, this is all done
            through JavaScript. I implemented the various elements from the lectures in the assignment through the various
            event listeners and conditionals that contain the rest of the elements.

        <h3>
            Recapitulation of the lectures
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the week 4 lectures we learned about animating, for this we used the greensocks API. This was a part of JavaScript that
            I had never used before, or any API in general. As such this was the first time that I learned something really
            new. I didn’t have much trouble with it however, as the greensocks API is very understandable in its functions.
            The week 5 lecture consisted of timekeeping using the Date object, during this week I learned new tips and tricks
            on how to store and use this Date object, such as how to call multiple functions with multiple variables in an
            interval loop, as this was something that I didn’t know before. </p>
        <h3>

        <p>
            The second assignment that I created was to be an animated, working, representative clock. As such we had to use the greensocks
            API and the Date object. I decided to try and implement a very clean and efficient code to try and experiment
            with how trimmed down I could get the file. As of writing this, the line count stands at 61 lines of code, including
            empty separator lines and broken up arrays. I placed these all in an interval loop as learned in class, but since
            I wanted multiple functions to run in parallel, each with their own parameters, I had to find another way. Which
            I did with the anonymous function method. I then used greensocks to animate the clock in a pulsating method,
            reverting scale direction every second using a conditional that checks for the modulo of the time.

            In the two final lectures we learned about other API’s, their possibilities and how to use AJAX for certain API’s that require
            it. This was completely new terrain for me, since I had no experience with these API’s or AJAX. As such I paid
            close attention to the examples and kept copies of each and every one with comments to review later. As such
            I was able to work out the intricacies of the API’s and how AJAX functions. In the end I understood how to make
            an AJAX request, how to process it and how to work with it. For the Google Maps API I quite often turned to the
            reference, seeing the complexity and possibilities that it provides. </p>

            For our final assignment we had to simulate a shuttle returning to earth and wanting ground information, for this I decided
            to present the user with 3 possible landing zones, each using a object to store all the information with. Using
            these three objects I populated them with data from the openweather API. Giving each all the information required.
            Next I generated the map and placed it on the currently active city. If the user select one of the other cities
            the page contents are updated with the new data without having to re-fetch the information. The map is then panned
            to the new cities location.

            Final reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
            At the end of these 8 weeks I can say that I learned a great deal that I intend to use in the future. Since I want to make
            front-end development my future HTML, CSS and JavaScript cannot be ignored in my opinion. As such I have kept
            local copies of all examples, with explanation added, for future reference. Furthermore I gained a great deal
            of understanding for the usage of API’s, which I intend to use more actively in the near future if the situation
            or assignment allows it, seeing the strength they have. I will also keep in mind the various conventions set
            forth during these classes and workshops, as they are more effective and efficient than my old methods, such
            as object arrays. In the end I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this course and its pacing, I would like to
            have a bit more freedom in the assignments however, seeing as I have to adapt everything to SpaceX got a bit
            of a tedium after a while. Finally I would say that it might be better in the future to present this course way
            earlier on in the program, as its possibilities are enormous. As such maybe try and intertwine this with the
            skills lab in the first period.
